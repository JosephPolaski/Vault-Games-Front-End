This repository contains the front-end architecture for the vault games administrative dashboard. This will serve as a master copy and all work should be coordinated by team members and worked on in a separate branch. Pull requests should be submitted and reviewed by teammates unless otherwise agreed upon. This is to insure the integrity of the project.

**Use the following steps:**


1. Clone a local copy by navigating to your desired working directory in the terminal and using the following commands:

- If you already have a working copy of the repository skip steps 1 and 2.

```
git clone https://github.com/JosephPolaski/cs340-group47-project-front.git
```
2. Create a new working branch for yourself using the following command and naming format to signify that it is a development branch.

```
git checkout -b lastname-dev
```
3. If this is not the first time you are working on the project make sure to update your local repository from the working version of the master branch.

```
git pull origin master
```
Otherwise, make sure to commit any changes you have made

```
git commit -a -m "Your commit message here"
```


4. When you have finished working and are ready to push your commits to your branch:

```
git push origin lastname-dev
```

5. Navigate back to the repository on github and select your branch. Click on the pull request button and send pull request!
